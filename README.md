## Overview

I built this app with the purpose of testing how much English my students have learned from my PE class. I wanted my app to be as frictionless as possible in order to get a high partipation rate.

## Demo

Provide a link to a live demo of your app if it's hosted online.

## Features

- Frictionless "log-in"
- Flashcards for students to review
- Quiz for students to test retained knowledge
- Firebase configuration to let teachers know who has completed

## Getting Started

The app is optimized for mobile and tablet devices.
The flow is very intuitive, after teaching students how to use it once, they should be able to figure it out on their own next time.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/TdevDev/dyjh-pe-app

\*\* Remember to install any dependencies required for a Vite project.

\*\* If you want to collect user completion data, you need to set up firebase or a backend of your own.

## Usage

-Students can come here to review and test the vocabulary they have learned in class.
-Step by step "log-in" that creates a password-less "log-in" for students based on their grade, class number and student number.
-Students can complete a lesson but scoring more than 66% on their unit quiz.
-Teachers can collect information on students that completed their assignment.
-Teachers can add extra points to students' final scores.

## Technologies Used
